# plc-learning-journey
This repository documents my hands-on learning path toward becoming a Controls/Mechatronics Engineer.  
I am working through Siemens LOGO! Soft Comfort, then progressing to Siemens TIA Portal projects.

Each level contains structured tasks, ladder logic diagrams, explanations, and project files.

## Level 1 - Core PLC Fundamentals (LOGO!)
**Status: Completed**

- Task 1: Basic ON/OFF Control  
- Task 2: Start/Stop Motor Latching (Seal-In Circuit)  
- Task 3: Emergency Stop Logic (NC safety contact, no auto-restart)  
- Task 4: Indicator Light Logic (Q2 mirrors Q1)

Each task includes:
- Goal  
- Ladder logic  
- Behavior table  
- Screenshots  
- Notes and lessons learned  


## Level 2 – Timers & Interlocks (LOGO!)
**Status: Completed**

- Task 1: On‑Delay Timer (TON)
- Task 2: Off‑Delay Timer (TOF)
- Task 3: Pulse Timer (TP) with LOGO‑specific pulse restart behaviour
- Task 4: Motor Interlock (Mutual Exclusion)
- Task 5: Three‑Step Sequence Control (Timed progression)

Each task includes:
- Goal
- Concept explanation

- Notes and lessons learned

## About This Repository

This repository is part of my transition from Mechatronics Technician to Controls/Mechatronics Engineer.  
I document each step publicly to stay accountable, build a portfolio, and share what I learn with others.

If you work in automation or controls engineering, I’d love your feedback or suggestions for future projects.
