## 📝 About This Repository

This repository is part of my transition from Mechatronics Technician to Controls/Mechatronics Engineer.  
I document each step publicly to stay accountable, build a portfolio, and share what I learn with others.

If you work in automation or controls engineering, I’d love your feedback or suggestions for future projects.
